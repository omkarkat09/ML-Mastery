# ML-Mastery
A collection of Python &amp; Machine Learning projects as part of my journey towards research &amp; industry excellence.


#1 🏡 Airbnb NYC Exploratory Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listings in New York City to understand pricing patterns and the factors influencing them.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Price Trends:** Prices vary significantly across boroughs; **Manhattan** listings are the most expensive.  
- **Outliers:** Some listings have unrealistic prices ($5,000+), affecting analysis.  
- **Correlations:** Room type, neighborhood, and availability strongly influence pricing.
